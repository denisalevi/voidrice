# pkgs_dirs (sequence: primitive)
#   env var string delimiter: ','
#   The list of directories where locally-available packages are linked
#   from at install time. Packages not locally available are downloaded
#   and extracted into the first writable directory.
pkgs_dirs:
  - ~/.conda/pkgs

# envs_dirs (sequence: primitive)
#   aliases: envs_path
#   env var string delimiter: ':'
#   The list of directories to search for named environments. When
#   creating a new named environment, the environment will be placed in
#   the first writable location.
#
envs_dirs:
  - ~/.conda/envs

# channels (sequence: primitive)
#   aliases: channel
#   env var string delimiter: ','
#   The list of conda channels to include for relevant operations.
#
channels:
  - defaults
  - conda-forge

# channel_priority (ChannelPriority)
#   Accepts values of 'strict', 'flexible', and 'disabled'. The default
#   value is 'flexible'. With strict channel priority, packages in lower
#   priority channels are not considered if a package with the same name
#   appears in a higher priority channel. With flexible channel priority,
#   the solver may reach into lower priority channels to fulfill
#   dependencies, rather than raising an unsatisfiable error. With channel
#   priority disabled, package version takes precedence, and the
#   configured priority of channels is used only to break ties. In
#   previous versions of conda, this parameter was configured as either
#   True or False. True is now an alias to 'flexible'.

channel_priority: strict
