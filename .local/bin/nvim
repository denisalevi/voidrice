# Use this nvim script to call bgcolor_nvim, which sets the background color
# using wal
# Previously, I just used an alias nvim="bgcolor_nvim", but this breaks
# tmux-resurrect, which only works for `nvim` commands
#
#~/.local/bin/bgcolor_nvim "$@"
#
# XXX: wal not installed currently, that setup was for LARBS. If not needed,
# remove this file
/usr/bin/nvim "$@"
